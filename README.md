adventure-js
============

Library to create point-and-click style adventure games in javascript

Dependencies
============
AdventureJS is currently developed to use the CreateJS library suite for HTML5 Canvas,
I'm a bit unclear on the WebGL support provided by [http://www.createjs.com/](CreateJS) but understand this is not far off. 
Otherwise it may be worth looking into porting to a more game oriented library such as [http://docs.gameclosure.com](game{closure}).
